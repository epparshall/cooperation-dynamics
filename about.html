                <h3>What is the Prisoner's Dilemma?</h3>
                <p>
                    The Prisoner's Dilemma is one of the most famous concepts in
                    game theory. It demonstrates why two rational individuals
                    might not cooperate, even when it's in their best interest
                    to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our game, you play 10 rounds against a computer opponent
                    that uses one of several classic game theory strategies.
                    Your goal is to maximize your score by choosing whether to
                    cooperate or defect each round.
                </p>

                <h3>The Strategies</h3>
                <p>
                    Our computer opponent randomly selects from these famous
                    strategies:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Always Cooperate:</strong> A trusting strategy
                        that always cooperates.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Always Defect:</strong> An aggressive strategy
                        that never cooperates.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Random:</strong> Makes random choices each
                        round.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Tit for Tat:</strong> Copies your previous move
                        - starts cooperative.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Grim Trigger:</strong> Cooperates until you
                        defect, then defects forever.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Pavlov:</strong> Repeats successful moves,
                        changes after poor outcomes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Generous Tit for Tat:</strong> Like Tit for Tat
                        but sometimes forgives defection.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Suspicious Tit for Tat:</strong> Like Tit for
                        Tat but starts with defection.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Tit for Tat + Noise:</strong> Tit for Tat with
                        occasional random moves.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why This Game Matters</h3>
                <p>
                    The Prisoner's Dilemma helps explain cooperation and
                    conflict in everything from international relations to
                    business negotiations to social interactions. Understanding
                    these strategies can help you think more strategically about
                    cooperation in real life.
