                <h3>Additional Information for EEA/UK Users</h3>
                <p>
                    If you are located in the European Economic Area or United
                    Kingdom, we process data in accordance with GDPR
                    requirements. Our legal basis for processing data through
                    third-party advertising is legitimate interest in funding
                    our free service.
                </p>

                <h3>California Privacy Rights</h3>
                <p>
                    California residents have specific rights under the
                    California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Since we do not
                    directly collect personal information, most CCPA provisions
                    do not apply. However, you have the right to opt out of the
                    sale of personal information by third parties through the
                    opt-out mechanisms mentioned above.
                </p>
